# Bookshelf

### https://mekintosz.github.io/library-project/

Bookshelf is a small vanilla web app for cataloguing personal reading lists. Users can add titles, track authors, log page counts, and cycle a book through reading states. Everything persists locally, so the shelf remains intact between visits.

### Tech Stack

- HTML5 for structure and accessibility semantics
- CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive card and modal layouts
- Vanilla JavaScript modules with DOM APIs, `FormData`, and `localStorage`

### Skills Practised

- Designing reusable classes (`Book`, `Library`) with clear data modelling
- Implementing event delegation for dynamic UI updates
- Managing state persistence with `localStorage`
- Validating and normalising user input before rendering
